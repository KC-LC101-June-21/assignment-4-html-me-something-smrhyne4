            <p>
               I have always loved building things.  In my youth, it was with Legos. Building forts out logs, also making a makeshift campsite with bed sheets in my room.  Now that I am older, I put that joy and excitement of creating as a child and use that in my woodworking projects.  Whether it is with a small build with minimal planning and execution, or with something bigger and more challenging, like kitchen cabinets.  I love using my own two hands to work through  projects and enjoy the process up to completion.

            <p>
               I remember while growing up and watching my Father working in our garage/workshop, and seeing how much he loved carpentry.  The image of him enjoying this trade made me wonder if I could do it.  As a child, I would sit in admiration of him using all sorts of machinery and tools to make different things.  Most of his work would be furniture.  From tables, to chests, bookshelves, or cabinets, seeing him work and embracing the challenges of woodworking has stuck with me my whole life.

               <h2>Ideas:</h2>
                  
               <p>
                  One of the main sources where I obtain my ideas for woodworking is on the internet.  My favorite resource for inspiration has to be <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest.com</a>. This site is an image sharing service where users can see other projects from different people or groups.  They range from paintings, to fashion, to jewelry, and carpentry work.  Some of the images have links attached to the picture to be able to give step by step instructions on how to build certian projects. I also enjoy reading woodworking magazines.  There are many, ‘How to‘ articles in these magazines and they also usually provide plans and a list of needed items to complete each project. Sometimes I will gain inspiration from a certain piece of furniture or a small wooden art project in stores; or while visiting a friend’s home, and I will create something based on these inspirations.

               <h2>Favorite Tools:</h2>
                  
               <p>
                  The tool that I find myself using a lot if not the most is the <strong>table saw or bench saw</strong>.  The blade protrudes through the top of the table so you make different cuts on the wood.  The most major cuts to make with this tool is a rip cut and a cross cut.<br>
A RIP cut is cutting the material lengthwise going with the grain of the wood.  This is the most common cut made on this saw.<br>  A CROSS cut is cutting the wood across the main grain.  This can be highly dangerous if you do not take the proper precautions and safety measures, which I will discuss later.<br>                       
 <strong>The Drill:</strong><br>
I use the drill for making round holes and tightening fasteners.  I use this a lot when bringing two or more pieces of wood together to make a tight fit so there can be no movement.<br>
<strong>Rotary tool:</strong><br>
I have come to love this tool.  This tool has multiple uses from carving, engraving, routing, and sharpening to name a few.  I love using this to carve.  It can be a very long process but the results can be rewarding in the end.<br>
<strong>The Hammer:</strong><br>
Consisting of a weighted head and a fixed long handle, this tool has been around for thousands of years.  They come in many different shapes and sizes, and are the go-to tool for artisans.
<strong>Sander:</strong><br>
The sander is one if not the main tool in anyone’s workshop.  This tool smooths the surface of the wood with sandpaper.  The sanders base moves very rapidly in a back and forth or circular motion to assist in helping smooth surfaces more quickly. The one I use the most is a palm/sheet sander.

                  <h2>Safety:</h2>
                     
                  <p>
                     Safety when working with any tool is the first and most important thing when working with any tool.  I cannot stress this enough.  I have learned through a very hard and painful experience that when working with tools, especially power tools, that you must take every precaution necessary.  I was making some decorative trays for my family to give out at Christmas.  While making my last tray I was cross cutting a long piece of wood.  Now remember I said that safety is the most important thing when working with tools.  Well I disregarded that.  I had taken the safety and kick back guards off of the saw in order to cut the wood more quickly.  As I was pushing the board through the blade, the wood got caught between the blade and the gauge and pulled my hand toward the saw, cutting off my thumb and badly cutting two other fingers.  Luckily the doctors were able to sew my thumb back on, but it could have been a lot worse. I am now on my way to a full recovery. But I will live with the scars as a reminder for, “Safety First.” The rest of my life. <br><br>

                     <h2>More on Safety:</h2>
Practicing this craft can be dangerous if you do not take the proper precautions, as I mentioned my accident earlier.  Ear protection is very helpful when I am working with loud machines.  They not only protect your hearing but can prevent dust from getting into your ears.  Glasses or goggles are great for protecting your eyes.  There have been several times that I had a piece of splinter or dust get into my eyes.  Gloves are another useful type of protection.  They help you grip materials easier and help you not to get splinters, or when I am staining wood.  I now always read all the safety guidelines when purchasing a new tool or research other ways of protecting myself while working.
